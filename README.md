# Lighter

Lighter is an opensource application for interacting with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Apache Hadoop YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html). It is hevily inspired by [Apache Livy](https://livy.incubator.apache.org/) and has some overlaping features.

Lighter supports:
- Interactive Python Sessions through [Sparkmagic](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/sparkmagic) kernel
- Batch application submissions through the REST API

> :warning: **If you are using interactive sessions**: While we have tested batch applications quite extensively, there might be some problems with interactive sessions, consider current release of Lighter as alpha.

You can read a breaf description on how Lighter works [here](./docs/architecture.md).
